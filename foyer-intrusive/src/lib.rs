/// Unsafe macro to get a raw pointer to an outer object from a pointer to one
/// of its fields.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use foyer_intrusive::container_of;
///
/// struct S { x: u32, y: u32 };
/// let container = S { x: 1, y: 2 };
/// let field = &container.x;
/// let container2: *const S = unsafe { container_of!(field, S, x) };
/// assert_eq!(&container as *const S, container2);
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This is unsafe because it assumes that the given expression is a valid
/// pointer to the specified field of some container type.
